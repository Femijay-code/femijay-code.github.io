    <p>Most people never think their device could be hacked — until it happens. In today’s digital world, your phone is a goldmine of private data, bank access, social accounts, and identity.</p>

    <p>Here are some warning signs that your phone or account may have been compromised.</p>

    <h5>🔍 1. Signs That You’ve Been Hacked</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Your phone is hot, slow, or the battery drains fast</li>
      <li>Friends receive weird texts or links from you</li>
      <li>You find apps you never installed</li>
      <li>Your mobile data usage suddenly spikes</li>
      <li>You’re locked out of your own accounts</li>
      <li>Your password or recovery info was changed</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>🛡️ 2. How to Protect Yourself — Even Before Anything Happens</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)</strong> on your email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and bank apps</li>
      <li><strong>Install apps only from official stores</strong> (Google Play, App Store)</li>
      <li><strong>Use a strong password</strong> — not your name, birth year, or "123456"</li>
      <li><strong>Turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi</strong> when not in use, especially in public places</li>
      <li><strong>Regularly check your app permissions</strong> and remove any that feel suspicious</li>
      <li><strong>Don’t click unknown links</strong>, even if they’re from a friend. Always confirm first.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>🚨 3. What To Do If You Suspect Your Phone or Account Has Been Hacked</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Change your password immediately</strong> — start with email, then banks and social media</li>
      <li><strong>Uninstall unknown or suspicious apps</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Run a scan</strong> using a trusted antivirus app</li>
      <li><strong>Log out of all devices</strong> (available on Facebook, Gmail, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Turn on 2FA</strong> if it wasn’t already enabled</li>
      <li><strong>Reset your phone</strong> if it keeps acting strange</li>
      <li><strong>Inform your contacts</strong> that your account may have been used for spam</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hackers often rely on silence, panic, or delay. If something feels wrong — act fast, stay calm, and take control of your digital safety.</p>

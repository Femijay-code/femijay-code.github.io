    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Cyber Hygiene Blog</strong> — a series dedicated to online safety awareness, written in a clear, relatable way for the everyday internet user.</p>

    <p>In today’s connected world, cyber threats are no longer just a tech problem — they’re a people problem. From mobile scams to social media impersonation, everyone is a target. This blog exists to help you avoid becoming a victim.</p>

    <p>Each post will cover practical topics like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to recognize phishing scams and fake websites</li>
      <li>Why weak passwords are a silent threat — and how to fix them</li>
      <li>What to do if your phone or email is hacked</li>
      <li>How to reduce your digital footprint and stay private</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal is simple: to equip you with the mindset and habits of someone who is cyber-aware — not paranoid, but protected.</p>

    <p>This isn’t about complicated tools or technical jargon. It’s about basic safety made easy and actionable.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting — and stay tuned for the next post.</p>

    <p><strong>Posted:</strong> June 2, 2025</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Phishing is one of the most common ways people get hacked ‚Äî and it's getting harder to recognize. A phishing message is designed to look real, gain your trust, and trick you into giving up something valuable, like your password or money.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 simple ways to spot phishing messages:</p>

    <h5>1. The message creates urgency</h5>
    <p>If an email or SMS says things like "Your account will be blocked in 1 hour" or "Immediate action required," take a pause. Scammers use pressure tactics to rush you into mistakes.</p>

    <h5>2. It asks for sensitive information</h5>
    <p>Legitimate organizations will never ask you to send your password, PIN, or card details through email, text, or chat.</p>

    <h5>3. The link doesn‚Äôt match the real website</h5>
    <p>Hover over the link (on a computer) or long-press it (on mobile) before clicking. If the domain looks suspicious, don‚Äôt click. Example: <code>bank-secure-login.com</code> is not the same as <code>bank.com</code>.</p>

    <h5>4. Poor grammar or odd phrasing</h5>
    <p>Many phishing messages contain awkward language, spelling mistakes, or strange formatting. That‚Äôs often a red flag that the sender is not who they claim to be.</p>

    <h5>5. The sender‚Äôs email address is off</h5>
    <p>The name may look familiar, but always check the actual email address. If it says something like <code>support@paypalsecurity-alerts.ru</code>, it‚Äôs fake.</p>

    <p><strong>What to do if you're unsure:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don‚Äôt click. Visit the company‚Äôs website directly instead.</li>
      <li>Contact the sender through official support channels.</li>
      <li>Report suspicious emails to your email provider or IT/security team.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Phishing is effective because it's psychological. But with awareness and a few quick checks, you can avoid falling for it ‚Äî even when it looks convincing.</p>
